# aquarium-app
This is a web application for proper aquarium care, implemented using Node and MongoDB. The application is designed to simulate aquariums you would create in real life, and it will intelligently tell the user the optimal temperature and pH ranges, as well as how full the aquarium is stocked, based on the type and number of fish put in the aquarium.
